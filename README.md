# Tic-Tac-Toe

Text-based version of the popular game Tic-Tac-Toe. 

I decided to keep it simple and use this as an exercise in computer-gaming logic over anything else. 

Thus, the board is depicted as a series of 9 dashes instead of the classic squares.

Users must choose number 1-9 to pick a "square" to place their mark. 

The function random.randint() was used to choose whether X or O goes first. 

A scoreboard keeps track of the score over multiple games. This resets once the code is terminated. 

At the end of each match, the user may choose whether to play another game or not. 

Enjoy!
